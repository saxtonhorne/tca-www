					<p>Next to a house, a vehicle is most likely your customers' most significant investment and, like most large investments, they want to protect it.</p> 

					<p>Partly to ensure a better resale value and partly because they see a vehicle as an extension of themselves and develop an emotional bond to it, they want to keep their vehicle looking as new as the day they bought it. That's why many car buyers want coverage from Total Care Auto to protect their vehicle and keep it looking showroom new.</p>

					<p>Total Care Auto Appearance protects a vehicle's most exposed and used surfaces for five years: the paint, the seat fabric, the carpeting and headliner, the leather and vinyl, and it also includes a noise-deadening undercoating. Customers love and are willing to pay for the peace of mind that comes with protecting their car without parking in the back of the parking lot or implementing a no food in the backseat rule.</p> 

					<p>If the products fail to perform as stated in the contract, we will pay to repair the damage.</p>

					<h3 id="exterior-protection" name="exterior-protection">Exterior Protection</h3>
					<p>The exterior is the hardest working part of a vehicle. Salt and sand in the winter, relentless sun in the summer, an errant pitch here, a shopping cart there, and it doesn't take long before a new car doesn't look new anymore.</p>

					<p>Just think about how excited your customers will be when they find out Total Care Exterior Protection will keep their vehicle's exterior looking showroom new for years after the sale.</p>

					<p>Total Care exterior protection includes both Paint Protection and Paint-Free Dent and Ding repair. For five years, Paint Protection guards against deterioration, fading or oxidation caused by sun, weather, dirt, humidity, household detergents or salt air. If, at any point during coverage, there is damage to the paint, we will pay to repair it.</p>

					<p>Total Care Paint-Free Dent and Ding repair is a process that can remove door dings and minor dents without harming the vehicle's paint. Customers receive unlimited side panel, paint-free ding and dent repair for five full years.</p>

					<h3 id="interior-protection" name="interior-protection">Interior Protection</h3>
					<p>The interior of a vehicle is on the front line. It's the first thing someone notices when they get into a car, and it's the part of the car you spend the most time in contact with. Unfortunately kids, pets, snow, mud, rain and even time all take their toll on a vehicle's seats and carpet leaving them stained and worn. Total Care Auto Fabric Protection will protect a vehicle's interior against everyday spills, fading, soiling and permanent stains for five full years. If staining begins to occur and it can't be cleaned, we will pay to repair or replace the stained fabric.</p>

					<p>We also provide protection if your customer has leather seats. It's true that they are generally more durable than cloth, but they are still susceptible to cracking and fading. Total Care Auto Leather and Vinyl protection prevents that. For five years after treatment, the leather seats or vinyl dash will look showroom new and will not fade or crack. If it is damaged by fading or deterioration, we will pay for the repair.</p>

					<p>With Total Care Interior Protection, customers will love the peace of mind that comes with not worrying about the interior of their car and instead just using their car and living their life.</p>

					<h3 id="undercoating" name="undercoating">Undercoating</h3>
					<p>Even though manufacturers do a pretty good job of making the inside of a vehicle quiet, it can still get noisy. A vehicle with a quieter ride seems more expensive and provides better customer satisfaction. Total Care Auto Undercoating helps quiet the road in even the loudest situations. It adds an extra layer of insulation between the driver and the road. This is a small upgrade that makes a big difference. And, of course, we'll stand behind this product too. If the undercoating starts to deteriorate or fail to perform properly, we'll reapply it.</p>
