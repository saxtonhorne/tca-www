					<p>Next to your house, your vehicle is your most significant investment. Protecting that investment can mean thousands of dollars when you do decide to sell it or trade it in.  Resale value aside, let's face it, we love our vehicles and want them to always look like new.</p>

					<p>The problem is, no matter how diligent you are, you can't keep your car in a sealed bubble. Life happens. You use your car; shopping carts dent doors, kids spill in the backseat and the elements never stop assaulting your vehicle.</p> 

					<p>That's why many car buyers have come to depend on coverage from Total Care Auto to protect their investment, to keep their vehicle looking showroom new, and to give them peace of mind. No longer will you need to park in the back of the parking lot or have a no food in the backseat rule.</p>

					<h3 id="exterior-protection" name="exterior-protection">Exterior Protection</h3>
					<p>The exterior is the hardest working part of a vehicle. Salt and sand in the winter, relentless sun in the summer, an errant pitch here, a shopping cart there, and it doesn't take long before a new car doesn't look new anymore.</p>
					
					<p>Total Care Exterior Protection will help keep your vehicle's exterior looking showroom new for many years after you drive it off the lot.</p>
					
					<p>Total Care exterior protection includes both Paint Protection and Paint-Free Dent and Ding repair. For five years, Paint Protection guards against deterioration, fading or oxidation caused by sun, weather, dirt, humidity, household detergents or salt air. If, at any point during coverage, there is damage to the paint, we will repair it.</p>
					
					<p>Total Care Paint-Free Dent and Ding repair is a process that can remove door dings and minor dents without harming the vehicle's paint. You'll receive unlimited side panel, paint-free ding and dent repair for five full years.</p>

					<h3 id="interior-protection" name="interior-protection">Interior Protection</h3>
					<p>The interior of a vehicle is on the front line; it's the part of the car you spend the most time in contact with. Unfortunately kids, pets, snow, mud, rain and even time all take their toll on a vehicle's seats and carpet leaving them stained and worn. Total Care Auto Fabric Protection will protect a vehicle's interior against everyday spills, fading, soiling and permanent stains for five full years. If staining begins to occur and it can't be cleaned, we will repair or replace the stained fabric.</p>
					
					<p>We also provide protection for leather seats. While they are generally more durable than cloth, they're still susceptible to cracking and fading. Total Care Auto Leather and Vinyl protection prevents that. For five years after treatment, the leather seats or vinyl dash will look showroom new and will not fade or crack. If it is damaged by fading or deterioration, we will repair it.</p>
					
					<p>With Total Care Interior Protection, you'll love the peace of mind that comes with not worrying about the interior of your car.</p>

					<h3 id="undercoating" name="undercoating">Undercoating</h3>
					<p>Even though manufacturers do a pretty good job of making the inside of a vehicle quiet, it can still get noisy. A car with a quieter ride feels more expensive is more enjoyable to drive.</p>

					<p>Total Care Auto Undercoating helps quiet the road in even the loudest situations by adding an extra layer of insulation between you and the road. This is a small upgrade that makes a big difference. Because a quiet ride is a happy ride.</p>

					<p>And, of course, we'll stand behind this product too. If the undercoating starts to deteriorate or fail to perform properly, we'll reapply it.</p>
