					<p>We all know cars that have regular maintenance are safer and more reliable and can be the difference between being the person stranded on the side of the road and the person that stops to help them. Regular oil changes, safety inspections, and tire rotations ensure your vehicle will run smoothly, and safely, for a long time. In the case of your vehicle, a dollar of prevention is truly worth one hundred dollars of cure.</p>

					<p>With Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance, you'll be able to pick the plan that fits your driving whether you are on the road all the time for business or just have to run errands once in a while. And if you sell your car, no problem, you can cancel your remaining plan, or better yet, transfer it to the new owner because a car that comes with prepaid maintenance can sell faster and for more money. And the best part, when you pay for your vehicle's necessary maintenance upfront, you keep your car running smoothly and save money.</p>

					<h3 id="oil-changes" name="oil-changes">OIL CHANGES</h3>
					<p>Especially important if you do a lot of stop-and-go driving, regular oil changes can ensure your engine, a vehicle's most expensive component, lasts longer, gets optimal gas mileage and runs smoothly. Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance will cover up to six quarts of high quality engine oil with the ability to upgrade to synthetic or blended oils.</p>

					<h3 id="lubrication" name="lubrication">LUBRICATION OF MAJOR COMPONENTS</h3>
					<p>Dirt and grime in the summer and salt, sand and snow in the winter are hard on your car's lubricated components. A well-lubricated suspension system, steering linkages, and ball joints will work better, last longer and are safer.  That's why Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance makes sure all those components are properly lubricated and in good working order.</p>

					<h3 id="fluids" name="fluids">FLUIDS</h3>
					<p>Underneath your hood, tucked away in places your eyes have never seen, lives the lifeblood of your vehicle - the fluids. Crucial components such as brakes, power steering, the transmission and the cooling system require the correct amount of fluids to function properly. Not only will we make sure all your fluids are at the proper levels, we will even top them off if necessary. Plus, a certified technician will be able to see signs of potential problems when they check your fluids. Better for them to see it now than you to discover it later.</p>

					<h3 id="wiper-blade" name="wiper-blade">WIPER BLADE INSPECTION</h3>
					<p>Your car's wiper blades just sit there, mostly unnoticed for months on end, until you need them. It's not only frustrating, but also dangerous, when you discover they are worn and aren't doing their job. As part of every Total Care Auto Prepaid maintenance appointment, we'll ensure all the components of your wipers are up to par, from the motor, to the washer fluid pump, to the blades themselves.</p>

					<h3 id="tire-rotation" name="tire-rotation">TIRE ROTATION</h3>
					<p>Tire rotations, while very simple to do, are crucial for getting the most out of your tires. With Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance, you'll never forget a tire rotation again. It's included in every visit if you choose Plan B, every other visit if you choose Plans A or C. Because properly inflated and rotated tires mean more miles per gallon and less wear and tear on other components, we'll make sure all your tires are properly inflated every visit. We'll also check your tires for irregular wear that might indicate a potential mechanical or safety problem. </p>

					<h3 id="inspection" name="inspection">multi-point vehicle inspection</h3>
					<p>Just to make sure you're not one of those people you see stranded on the side of the road, a certified technician will go over your vehicle with a fine-tooth comb to ensure there aren't any surprises. If they spot anything that needs immediate attention, they will let you know so you can handle it before it becomes a bigger problem and potential safety hazard.</p>
