					<p>Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance is not only a great value for your customers, it's also a great way to reinforce the relationship between your service department and the customer.</p>  

					<p>The more often they visit, the more likely they'll visit you again when they need additional service or maintenance.</p> 

					<p>If they sell their car, they can cancel the remaining plan or transfer it to the new owner. A Prepaid Maintenance plan will add value to any vehicle, and when they transfer it, you have the ability to touch a new potential service customer.</p> 

					<p>Regardless of the plan customers choose, Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance includes: oil and filter change, lubrication of major components and tire rotation. A technician will also check and top off all major fluids including coolant, brake, transmission, powertrain, differential, steering and wiper fluid. The multi-point vehicle inspection provides extra peace of mind to customers and gives your service department the opportunity to provide additional services not covered by the prepaid maintenance on critical components such as belts, hoses, brakes, battery, exhaust system, steering and the suspension.</p>

					<h3 id="oil-changes" name="oil-changes">OIL CHANGES</h3>
					<p>Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance will cover up to six quarts of high quality engine oil with the ability to upsell customers to synthetic or blended oils. Especially important if you do a lot of stop-and-go driving, regular oil changes can ensure a customer's engine, a vehicle's most expensive component, lasts longer, gets optimal gas mileage and runs smoothly.</p> 

					<h3 id="lubrication" name="lubrication">LUBRICATION OF MAJOR COMPONENTS</h3>
					<p>Dirt and grime in the summer and salt, sand and snow in the winter are hard on a car's lubricated components. Well-lubricated suspension systems, steering linkages, and ball joints will work better, last longer and are safer. Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance makes sure all those components are properly lubricated and in good working order. This also gives you the opportunity to inspect those systems for signs of wear, giving you an opportunity to offer additional service.</p>

					<h3 id="fluids" name="fluids">FLUIDS</h3>
					<p>Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance provides customers with complete peace of mind â€”and that applies to a vehicle's critical fluids as well. As part of the visit you will check, and top off if necessary, brake, power steering, transmission and cooling system fluids. This gives your technicians additional opportunities to spot potential problems and give customers the option of having the additional service done at your facility. Even if you don't find something wrong, customers appreciate knowing that you checked and that things are in good shape.</p>

					<h3 id="wiper-blade" name="wiper-blade">WIPER BLADE INSPECTION</h3>
					<p>Most customers don't even think about a vehicle's windshield wipers - until they can't see because they're not doing their job. Total Care Auto gives you the opportunity to develop trust with customers by checking the wiper system from the motor, to the washer fluid pump, to the blades themselves. Of course, if you find something that needs fixing, you then have the opportunity to sell that service to the customer.</p>

					<h3 id="tire-rotation" name="tire-rotation">TIRE ROTATION</h3>
					<p>Tire rotations, while easy to do, are often neglected and have a high value in the mind of the consumer. With Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance, they'll never forget a tire rotation again. That, combined with the perceived value makes this component a powerful selling point for Prepaid Maintenance. It's included in every visit for Plan B, every other visit for Plans A or C. Also, checking tires for irregular wear that might indicate a potential mechanical or safety problem keeps your customer safe.</p>

					<h3 id="inspection" name="inspection">multi-point vehicle inspection</h3>
					<p>Total Care Auto Prepaid Maintenance will cover up to six quarts of high quality engine oil with the ability to upsell customers to synthetic or blended oils. Especially important if you do a lot of stop-and-go driving, regular oil changes can ensure a customer's engine, a vehicle's most expensive component, lasts longer, gets optimal gas mileage and runs smoothly.</p>
